        Friend,
      </p>

      <p>
        Common sense: it's been in short supply in Trenton for far too long.
      </p>

      <p>
        In it's place, years of 'business as usual' in our State Capitol have beaten New Jerseyans down into a culture of accepting the mess the insiders, special interests and failed politicians have created.
      </p>

      <p>
        They all think we're powerless to challenge Trenton, to fight for change and to bring common sense back to New Jersey.&nbsp;
        <span className="bold">Well, they're wrong.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Like you, we're done accepting the insiders' failure. And like you, we're ready to fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's why we formed&nbsp;
        <span className="bold italic">Elect Common Sense</span>.
        As the Honorary Chairman, I am proud to be guiding,&nbsp;
        <span className="italic">Elect Common Sense</span>&nbsp;
        as we rewrite the rules of engagement for fighting and winning in New Jersey.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Thank You,
      </p>

      <p>
